# Plural

Plural is a unified application delivery platform built on kubernetes.  It aims to make applications as portable as possible, without sacrificing the ability for the users to own the applications they desire to use.  Some key features of the platform include:

* Automated Upgrades
* Cross-tool dependency management
* GitOps workflow with batteries-included transparent secret encryption
* Built on common open source tools, so if you don't like us, you can always eject your application from plural and use it as you please.
