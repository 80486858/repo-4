# What is Plural?

Plural is an open-source, unified, application deployment platform that makes it easy to run open-source software on Kubernetes. It aims to make applications as portable as possible, without sacrificing the ability for the users to own the applications they desire to use. Some key features of the platform include:

* Automated Upgrades
* Cross-tool dependency management
* GitOps workflow with batteries-included transparent secret encryption
* Built on common open source tools, so if you don't like us, you can always eject your application from Plural and use it as you please.

# Deployment Options

You can deploy Plural in two ways:

* [Using the Plural CLI on your Machine](getting-started/README.md)
  * Click here if you want to manage configuration locally and prefer working out of your terminal.
* [Using our in-browser Cloud Shell](getting-started/cloud-shell-quickstart.md)
  * Click here if you want a more visual in-browser experience or if you want to try out Plural for free.
