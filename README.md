Aries-Askar, secure storage designed for Hyperledger Aries agents.

## Credit

The initial implementation of `aries-askar` was developed by the Verifiable Organizations Network (VON) team based at the Province of British Columbia. The database structure derives largely from the wallet design within [Hyperledger Indy-SDK](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk).
