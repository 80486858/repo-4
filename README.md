# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

## What is Plural?

Plural is an open-source, unified, application deployment platform that makes it easy to run open-source software on Kubernetes. Our marketplace has dozens of top tier applications ready to deply.

We aim to make applications as portable as possible, without sacrificing the ability for the users to own the applications they desire to use.&#x20;

Some key features of the platform include:

* Automated Upgrades
* Cross-tool dependency management
* GitOps workflow with batteries-included transparent secret encryption
* Built on common open source tools, so if you don't like us, you can always eject your application from Plural and use it as you please.

## Deployment Options

### Plural Cloud Shell

We have created a Cloud Shell with all of the tools and dependencies needed to run Plural. This is available [here](https://app.plural.sh/shell) to try out. If you want to **try out Plural without entering cloud credentials**, we offer a Kubernetes deployment and Cloud Shell deployment on the house that lasts for 6 hours.
