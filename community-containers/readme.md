## This is a WIP and not working yet!

You might want to add additional community containers to the default AIO stack. You can do so by adding `--env AIO_COMMUNITY_CONTAINERS="container1 container2"` to the docker run command of the mastercontainer (but before the last line `nextcloud/all-in-one:latest`! If it was started already, you will need to stop the mastercontainer, remove it (no data will be lost) and recreate it using the docker run command that you initially used) and customize the value to your fitting. It must match the folder names in this directory! ⚠️⚠️⚠️ Please review the folder for documentation on each of the containers before adding them! Not reviewing the documentation for each of them first might break starting the AIO containers because e.g. fail2ban only works on Linux and not on Docker Desktop!
