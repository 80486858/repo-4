# Introduction

Plural has two main components, each with their own graphql API:

* [Plural](plural-api.md) - available at https://app.plural.sh/gql
* [Plural Console](console-api.md) - deployable in any plural kubernetes cluster, and accessible at https://your.console.domain/gql

Each have a graphiql dashboard which can be used to play around at will with the APIs.  You can also use the schema explorer to view all the datatypes and query/mutation fields available for whatever automation you'd like to build.
